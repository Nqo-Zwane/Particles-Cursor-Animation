# Particles Cursor Animation ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

An immersive web experience project using Three.js to create a captivating particles cursor animation. This project leverages the power of WebGL and Three.js to render dynamic, interactive particles that follow the user's cursor, creating a mesmerising visual effect.

## Features
- **Interactive Particle Animation:** Particles dynamically follow the user's cursor, creating a visually engaging experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures smooth performance and responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Customizable:** Easily tweak particle properties like color, size, and movement speed to create your own unique effects.
- **Modern Web Technologies:** Built with Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for 3D graphics, and WebGL for rendering.
